#Enhanced to let you apply database functions to columns. These columns will be placed in the attributes of the base class
#
# ex. Contact.find :first, :include => :account, :select => 'now(), account.name, 123, "YOUR MOM" as blah'
#   returns a record where the now(), 123, and YOUR MOM is placed in contact['now()'] => "12007-07-09 blah', contact['123'] => '123', contact['blah'] => "YOUR MOM"
#   contact.account.name will return the account name
#   
# Also adding support for pre_sql, post_sql, keywords
